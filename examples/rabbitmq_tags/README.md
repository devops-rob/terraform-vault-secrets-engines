# RabbitMQ Secrets Engine with tags example

### Overview

In this example, the module will be used to enable and configure the RabbitMQ secrets engine with management tags.

### Example use case

In cases where engineers require Just-In-Time management access to RabbitMQ to administer the platform, configuring the RabbitMQ secrets engine with this example will allow authenticated and authorised Vault users to obtain temporary RabbitMQ credentials.

### RabbitMQ Requirements

Vault will require a RabbitMQ user with the Administrator management plugin tag.  No other permissions are required.

For more information about RabbitMQ Access and Permissions, refer to the [rabbitmqctl documentation.](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#permissions)

### Usage

Export the environment variables that contain the Vault token and RabbitMQ credentials.  Execute the following commands, replacing the variable values to match your environment:

```shell script
export TF_VAR_vault_token=root
export TF_VAR_rabbitmq_username=guest
export TF_VAR_rabbitmq_password=guest
```

Execute the following commands to run the example:

```shell script
terraform init
terraform plan -out=.tfplan
terraform apply .tfplan
```

To test the secrets engine is working as expected, run the following command as an authenticated Vault user:

```shell script
vault read rabbitmq/creds/test
```
